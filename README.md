Altough I'm not sure, changing the folder name may break the script. Just don't change it.

And I'm not sure about the installation because it's been a long time since I last used the script. But I think everything should work fine.

## Installation

- Add the items called "Nightvision" and "Thermalvision" in your database.

- Make sure you have ESX installed and working fine, a download link can be found below.

- [ESX](https://github.com/ESX-Org/es_extended)

- Then just copy "esx_hvszvision" to your resource files and start them from "server.cfg"

## Configuration

- In server.lua, you can edit the item name to whatever you want (Nightvision/Thermalvision -> X).
